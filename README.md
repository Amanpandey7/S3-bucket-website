# S3-bucket-website
Welcome to my dummy website! We are leveraging the power of Amazon S3 bucket for hosting this website.

This is an example on how a website can be hosted on S3 buckets. Following are the steps how achieved:

    Created an index.html file locally
    Created a S3 bucket in AWS console and upload the index.html file on it.
    Go to Properties Section and enable S3 bucket hosting website mode
    Change the bucket policy so that anyone can access the content of bucket.
